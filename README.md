# hubot cookbook

Deploys and manages an instance of [GitHub's Hubot](http://hubot.github.com/).

# Usage

Include `recipe[hubot]` in your run_list and override the defaults you want
changed. See [below](#-attributes) for more details. Hubot instances are
configured using environment variables passed to the Hubot process. These
environment variables can be set using the `node['hubot']['config']` attribute.

# Requirements

## Chef

Tested on Chef 11 but newer and older version should work just fine. File an
[issue][issues] if this isn't the case.

## Platform

The following platforms have been tested with this cookbook, meaning that the
recipes and LWRPs run on these platforms without error:

* Ubuntu 10.04, 11.04, 12.04, 12.10
* CentOS 5, 6

## Cookbooks

This cookbook depends on the following external cookbooks:

* [nodejs](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/nodejs) (mdxp)
* [git](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/git) (Opscode)
* [runit](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/runit) (Opscode)

# Recipes

## default

* Ensures that Node.js is installed and available using the
  [nodejs cookbook](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/nodejs).
* Ensures git is installed and available using the
  [git cookbook](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/git).
* Ensures runit is installed and available using the
  [runit cookbook](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/runit).
* Creates a user and group to install and run the Hubot instance under.
* Installs the specified Hubot version from git.
* Renders instance-specific `package.json`, `hubot-scripts.json`, and
 `hubot.conf` files.
* Creates and enables a `hubot` runit service to run the Hubot instance under.
  The runit service reads the `hubot.conf` file and passes the contents onto
  the underlying hubot process as configuraiton.
