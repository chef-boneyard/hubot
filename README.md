# hubot cookbook

Deploys and manages an instance of [GitHub's Hubot](http://hubot.github.com/).

# Usage

Include `recipe[hubot]` in your run_list and override the defaults you want
changed. See [below](#attributes) for more details. Hubot instances are
configured using environment variables passed to the Hubot process. These
environment variables can be set using the `node['hubot']['config']` attribute.

I hightly recommend integrating this cookbook into your own infrastruce using
the
[library/application cookbook pattern](http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-to-write-reusable-chef-cookbooks.html).
You would start by creating a `YOURCOMPANY-hubot` cookbook with a proper
metadata depedency on the `hubot` (this) cookbook. A concrete example can be
found [on this gist](https://gist.github.com/schisamo/46eafba27d43c4a1e026)
which was created from bits of the internal `opscode-hubot` cookbook which we
use to deploy, Paula Deen, Opscode's hubot instance.

One important item to note is the use of the
[remote_directory](http://docs.opscode.com/resource_remote_directory.html)
resource to distribute our internal hubot scripts to the install:

```ruby
remote_directory "#{node['hubot']['install_dir']}/scripts" do
  source "scripts"
  files_backup 0
  files_owner node['hubot']['user']
  files_group node['hubot']['group']
  files_mode 00644
  owner node['hubot']['user']
  group node['hubot']['group']
  overwrite true
  mode 00755
  notifies :restart, "service[hubot]", :delayed
end
```

# Requirements

## Chef

Tested on Chef 11 but newer and older version should work just fine. File an
[issue][issues] if this isn't the case.

## Platform

The following platforms have been tested with this cookbook, meaning that the
recipes and LWRPs run on these platforms without error:

* Ubuntu 10.04, 11.04, 12.04, 12.10
* CentOS 6

## Cookbooks

This cookbook depends on the following external cookbooks:

* [nodejs](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/nodejs) (mdxp)
* [git](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/git) (Opscode)
* [runit](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/runit) (Opscode)

# Recipes

## default

* Ensures that Node.js is installed and available using the
  [nodejs cookbook](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/nodejs).
* Ensures git is installed and available using the
  [git cookbook](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/git).
* Ensures runit is installed and available using the
  [runit cookbook](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/runit).
* Creates a user and group to install and run the Hubot instance under.
* Installs the specified Hubot version from git.
* Renders instance-specific `package.json`, `hubot-scripts.json`, and
 `hubot.conf` files.
* Creates and enables a `hubot` runit service to run the Hubot instance under.
  The runit service reads the `hubot.conf` file and passes the contents onto
  the underlying hubot process as configuraiton.

# Testing

This cookbook ships with full support for the new alpha version of Opscode's
`test-kitchen`. [Fletcher Nichol's](https://github.com/fnichol) excellent Jamie
integration test runner was
[recently merged into the test-kitchen codebase](http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef-dev/2013-01/msg00038.html).
This merge and all new feature work are now taking place in the
[1.0 branch of test-kitchen](https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen/tree/1.0).
Even though many community members have been dogfooding the new `test-kitchen`
codebase and it has proven quite stable, it should still be regarded as
pre-release code and YMMV.

Running integration with test-kitchen is easy. First we'll assume you have a
sane cookbook development toolchain installed which includes:

* Git
* Ruby 1.9.x
* Bundler
* VirtualBox 4.x

If you need help setting up this toolchain, take a read through the
"[System Setup](http://vialstudios.com/guide-authoring-cookbooks.html#system_setup)"
section of [Jamie Winsor's](https://github.com/reset) excellent cookbook
authoring guide.

First install all gem dependencies with Bundler:

```shell
$ bundle install --binstubs
```

Bundler will install all of the dependent RubyGems and guarantee that you have
the right versions. Now it's time to get your test on:

```shell
$ bundle exec kitchen test
```

This command will do the following across every platform/version this cookbook
supports:

* Use Vagrant to provision a platform-specific VM.
* Add a `recipe[hubot]` entry to the instance's run_list.
* Converge the VM with `chef-solo`.

By default, any VM that successfully converges will automaticallly be cleaned
up. The full set of `kitchen` subcommands can be viewed by running:

```shell
$ bundle exec kitchen help
```

# Development

* Source hosted at [GitHub][repo]
* Report issues/Questions/Feature requests on [GitHub Issues][issues]

I <3 pull requests! Make sure your patches are well tested. Ideally create a
topic branch for every separate feature/fix you make.
